<h1>Ceasar Cipher<h1/>

<p>This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. By providing a shift number and a plain text, the program generates the corresponding cipher text. 
  The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plain text is shifted by a certain number in the alphabet, creating a simple yet effective encryption method. 
  This tool can be used to explore basic encryption techniques and understand how classical ciphers work.<p/>
